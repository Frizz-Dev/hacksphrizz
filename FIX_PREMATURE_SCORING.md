# ‚úÖ FIXED: Trust Score Generated Too Early

## Problem
Trust score was being fetched from database on page load (during passenger details), not when moving to checkout tab.

## Root Cause

### 1. **Automatic Fetching on Initialization**
`src/hooks/useBehaviorTracking.js` line 97:
```javascript
// This was fetching old score from database immediately!
fetchCurrentTrustScore();
```

### 2. **UI Displaying Score Before Analysis**
Score was shown in UI panels even though no analysis had been done yet in this session.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Disabled Auto-Fetch** (useBehaviorTracking.js)
```javascript
// Line 96-98: DISABLED automatic fetching
// DON'T fetch initial trust score automatically!
// Score should only be fetched when explicitly requested (e.g., on checkout)
// fetchCurrentTrustScore(); // DISABLED - only fetch on demand
```

### 2. **Added Analysis Flag** (useBehaviorTracking.js)
```javascript
// Line 30: Track if analysis has been done
hasAnalyzed: false, // NEW: Track if analysis has been done

// Line 252: Set flag when analysis completes
hasAnalyzed: true, // Mark that analysis has been completed
```

### 3. **Added Checkout Analysis Flag** (book/page.js)
```javascript
// Line 30: Track if checkout analysis was triggered
const [hasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis, setHasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis] = useState(false);

// Line 168: Set flag when moving to checkout
setHasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis(true); // Mark that checkout analysis was triggered
```

### 4. **Conditional UI Display** (book/page.js)
```javascript
// Line 516: Only show score after checkout analysis
Score: {(hasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis && behaviorTracking.currentTrustScore !== null)
  ? (behaviorTracking.currentTrustScore * 100).toFixed(1) + '%'
  : 'Not analyzed yet'}

// Line 560: Only show TrustScoreDisplay after checkout
{hasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis &&
 behaviorTracking.currentTrustScore !== null && ... (
  <TrustScoreDisplay ... />
)}

// Line 625: Only show score after checkout
Trust Score: {(hasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis && behaviorTracking.currentTrustScore !== null)
  ? (behaviorTracking.currentTrustScore * 100).toFixed(1) + '%'
  : 'Not analyzed yet'}
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
1. User opens /book page
2. OLD score from database loads immediately ‚ùå
3. Score shows "20%" from previous session ‚ùå
4. User fills form
5. Moves to checkout
6. Score stays same (already loaded) ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```
1. User opens /book page
2. NO score loaded ‚úÖ
3. UI shows "Not analyzed yet" ‚úÖ
4. User fills form
5. Moves to checkout ‚Üí TRIGGERS NEW ANALYSIS ‚úÖ
6. NEW score calculated and displayed ‚úÖ
```

## What You'll See Now

### Steps 1-4 (Before Checkout):
- Blue banner: "Score: Not analyzed yet"
- Yellow panel: "Trust Score: Not analyzed yet"
- Right panel: No TrustScoreDisplay component

### Step 5 (Checkout):
- Console: `üî•üî•üî• [CHECKOUT] Moving to checkout (step 4‚Üí5) - TRIGGERING NEW ANALYSIS`
- Analysis runs...
- Console: `‚úÖ Trust score updated in state`
- Score appears in all panels with NEW value!

## Testing

1. **Refresh page** or open in new tab
2. Go to `/book`
3. **Check UI**: Should show "Not analyzed yet" everywhere
4. Fill passenger details (any step 1-4)
5. **Check UI**: Should still show "Not analyzed yet"
6. Click to move to **Checkout** (step 5)
7. **Check console**: Should see üî• fire logs
8. **Check UI**: Score should now appear with FRESH calculation!

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `src/hooks/useBehaviorTracking.js`
   - Disabled fetchCurrentTrustScore() on init
   - Added hasAnalyzed flag

2. ‚úÖ `src/app/book/page.js`
   - Added hasTriggeredCheckoutAnalysis flag
   - Conditional rendering of scores
   - Only show after checkout navigation

---

**Status**: Trust score will ONLY be calculated and shown when navigating to checkout! ‚úÖ
