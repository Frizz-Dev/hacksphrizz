### 🎉 **Summary**
**Everything is working perfectly!** The system now operates exclusively with rule-based detection as requested. The AI toggle has been successfully commented out from both Checkout and PassengerDetails components. Users will experience seamless bot detection without any UI complexity, and the system automatically falls back to the proven rule-based method.

**Ready for production use! ✨**
